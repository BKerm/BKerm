there is a throbbing electrical pulse at my desk. the thing i havent done. i hear it from every room in my cell. its a nice cell. three rooms and two full baths. very expensive and i know my parents loved me since they bought me this cell before i was even born. they did well when they were alive. not great but well. better than my friends at the well-house.
